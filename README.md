- 👋 Hi, I’m @doublesdd04
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better everyday at coding specifically but also learning the industry and what it uses, which is why I created a git account.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web page development and java in school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specifically right now. I am not good enough. But there will come a time.
- 📫 How to reach me... jellis@madisoncollege.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: whatever you want to use. I born a male and therefore I am a male.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love all this stuff. Computers, math, coding, webpages, all of it. I know I am just scratching the surface of what I can do.
